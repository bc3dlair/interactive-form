      <h2>Custom Orders</h2>
      <p>
        All custom 3D printed items are made to order based on the specifications provided by the customer.
        It is the customer’s responsibility to ensure all dimensions, design files, and details submitted are accurate.
        I am not responsible for errors resulting from incorrect measurements, files, or specifications provided.
      </p>

      <h2>Print Characteristics</h2>
      <p>
        3D printed products may contain minor surface imperfections, layer lines, or slight dimensional tolerances inherent to the 3D printing process.
        These characteristics do not constitute defects.
      </p>

      <h2>Color Variation</h2>
      <p>
        Colors may vary slightly from digital previews due to filament manufacturing variations and screen differences.
      </p>

      <h2>Functional Use</h2>
      <p>
        Functional parts are printed based on the requested use, but I do not guarantee performance under high stress, heat exposure, outdoor conditions,
        or food contact unless explicitly agreed upon in writing. The customer assumes responsibility for proper and safe use of the product.
      </p>

      <h2>Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        Custom orders are non-refundable once printing has begun. Refunds or replacements due to printer malfunction or confirmed production error will be handled at my discretion.
      </p>

      <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        I reserve the right to refuse any order that violates intellectual property rights, trademark laws, or copyright protections.
      </p>

      <h2>Order Acceptance</h2>
      <p>
        Submission of this form does not guarantee order acceptance. Orders are confirmed only after pricing approval and receipt of any required deposit.
